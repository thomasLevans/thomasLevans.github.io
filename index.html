        As a software engineer I harden my focus to the constant delivery of clean, robust code that adheres to patterns and best practices while meeting the requirements of the minimal viable product. I am highly adaptable, equally comfortable with both new and legacy technology. While I find I prefer backend work, I have no problem jumping into the frontend.
        
        I am constantly broadening my knowledge of software engineering principles and patterns, iteratively sharpening my skills as a developer to create solvent solutions with real business value. I intend to continue my journey as a life long learner, expanding my expertise to areas of security, dev ops, and in the near future a masters degree.
        
        I have contributed to a few open source projects over the last two years, and look forward to continuing to participate in the open source community. For the most part my github holds various projects that stem from a desire to learn about some framework or language that has caught my interest. Most are prototypal in nature and served as personal learning exercises. Have a project and need help? Feel free to contact me regarding collaborations, I am always open to new projects.

        <p>
        Developed for the Medical University of South Carolina with the cooperation of the Biometrics Informatics Research Group, the dashboard has been an ongoing project of mine since December 2015. Leveraging MUSC's participation in Open Linked Data, the dashboard allows the user to track the research trends of an institution in terms of the bridge from basic to clinical science based research. Checkout the live [demo](http://jobeid.github.io/tsdashboard/)!

        <h4>Topsoil</h4>
        <p>
        Developed in the Cyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for the Earth Sciences (CIRDLES), Topsoil is a visualization tool built on the Java 8 webkit to aid geochronologists in generating visualizations of sample data for publication. Topsoil's visualizations are powered by the D3.js library, leveraging easily exportable scalable vector graphics. Over a period of five months I aided in the refinement of Topsoil's chart rendering, and integrated unit testing via Karma.js. For more information checkout the [project](http://cirdles.org/projects/topsoil/)!
