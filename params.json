  "body": "# Who I Am\r\n>\"Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and has powers of reality\" - Frank Herbert\r\n\r\nAs a software engineer I harden my focus to the constant delivery of clean, robust code that adheres to patterns and best practices while meeting the requirements of the minimal viable product. I am highly adaptable, equally comfortable with both new and legacy technology. While I find I prefer backend work, I have no problem jumping into the frontend.\r\n\r\nI am constantly broadening my knowledge of software engineering principles and patterns, iteratively sharpening my skills as a developer to create solvent solutions with real business value. I intend to continue my journey as a life long learner, expanding my expertise to areas of security, dev ops, and in the near future a masters degree.\r\n\r\nI have contributed to a few open source projects over the last two years, and look forward to continuing to participate in the \r\nopen source community. For the most part my github holds various projects that stem from a desire to learn about some framework \r\nor language that has caught my interest. Most are prototypal in nature and served as personal learning exercises. Have a project and need help? Feel free to contact me regarding collaborations, I am always open to new projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n## My Experience\r\n\r\n__Software Engineer__  \r\n{SAW} Software Mill  \r\n_June '15 - Present_\r\n\r\n__Software Engineer (Intern)__  \r\nCyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for the Earth Sciences  \r\n_Dec '14 - May '15_\r\n\r\n__Software Engineer (Intern)__  \r\nBiomedical Informatics Center at the Medical University of South Carolina  \r\n_Nov '14 - June '15_\r\n\r\n\r\n## My Education\r\n\r\n__B.A. Computer Science__  \r\nCollege of Charleston  \r\nGPA 3.8\r\n\r\n__A.S.

Leveraging MUSC's participation in Open Linked Data, the\r\ndashboard allows the user to track the research trends of an institution in terms of the\r\nbridge from basic to clinical science based research.\r\n\r\n__Topsoil__  \r\nDeveloped in the Cyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for\r\nthe Earth Sciences (CIRDLES), Topsoil is a visualization tool built on the Java 8 webkit to aid\r\ngeochronologists in generating visualizations of sample data for publication. Topsoil's visualizations\r\nare powered by the D3.js library, leveraging easily exportable scalable\r\nvector graphics. Over a period of five months I aided in the refinement\r\nof Topsoil's chart rendering, and integrated unit testing via Karma.js.\r\n\r\n\r\n## My Work\r\n> \"The beginning of knowledge is the discovery of something we do not understand.\" - Frank Herbert\r\n\r\nProject | Goals | Tools | Link | Status\r\n--------|-------|-------|------|---------\r\n_tudr_ | TBD | TBD | | _WIP_\r\n_RustForge_ | TBD | TBD | | _WIP_\r\n_GMO Vis_ | TBD | TBD | | _WIP_\r\n_VotingExample_ | TBD | TBD | | _closed_\r\n_ConnectFour_ | TBD | TBD | | _closed_\r\n_Wallie's Wand Shop_ | TBD | TBD | | _closed_\r\n\r\n\r\n## My Contact Info\r\nEmail | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-evans-46ba187a)",
